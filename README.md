- **Global state management** using React Context API
- **Professional UX** with notifications, loading spinners, and responsive design
- **TypeScript** for enhanced development experience

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with:
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pesaflow
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB:**
   ```bash
   # If using Docker (recommended):
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Or start local MongoDB service
   mongod
   ```

5. **Run the backend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file with:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Run the frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Quick Test Data

Use these demo member numbers for testing:
- `MEM001` - Admin user with full access
- `MEM002` - Regular user  
- `MEM003` - Another regular user

*Note: Create users through the API first, then accounts can be created for them.*

## ✅ What Works

### Fully Functional Features:
- **User Management**: Complete CRUD operations for members
- **Account Management**: Savings tracking, balance updates, account status management
- **Transaction Processing**: Create, view, approve/reject transactions
- **Authentication**: Member number-based login with role differentiation
- **Admin Dashboard**: Transaction approval workflow, system statistics
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data refresh and state management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation
- **API Documentation**: Complete Postman collection for testing

### Technical Implementation:
- **Database**: All models with proper relationships and validation
- **Backend**: RESTful API with error handling and logging
- **Frontend**: Modern React with TypeScript and proper state management
- **Integration**: Seamless communication between all layers

## ⚠️ What Doesn't Work Yet / Limitations

### Known Limitations:
1. **Password Authentication**: Currently uses member number only (simplified for demo)
2. **File Uploads**: No document upload functionality yet
3. **Email Notifications**: Email system not implemented
4. **Advanced Reports**: Charts and analytics are placeholder
5. **Deployment**: Not yet deployed to production hosting

### Future Enhancements:
- **Real Authentication**: JWT tokens, password hashing, session management
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts for financial data
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed transaction history and system logs
- **Backup System**: Automated database backups
- **Mobile App**: React Native version for mobile access

### Development Notes:
- Some admin features are basic implementations
- Transaction categories could be more sophisticated
- Pagination works but could be enhanced with search
- Theme switching is partially implemented

## 🛠️ Development Tools

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Development**: Nodemon, ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing**: Jest setup (basic configuration)
- **Database**: MongoDB with Docker support
